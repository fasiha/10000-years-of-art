> This remarkable bronze statue, 2.6m (8.5ft) tall including its base, is the poster child (and traveling ambassador) for Sanxingdui. It is literally unique, the only complete figure of its size and kind that is currently known. ([Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanxingdui_Oct_2007_574.jpg))

> The Nok culture of northern Nigeria, a civilization that existed from approximately 500 B.C. to about 500 A.D., is principally known for its terracotta figures. Relatively little is known about the purpose of these figures or the civilization that created such extraordinary sculptural representations of its people. A few of the remarkable characteristics that distinguish Nok pieces from terracottas of later cultures in Nigeria include the triangular, pierced eyes; the elaborate coiffure and beard; and the placement of the ears. This work depicts a person of high status wearing elaborate beaded jewelry, and with a crooked baton on his right arm and a hinged flail on the left. These are symbols of authority also found in ancient Egyptian depictions of the Pharaohs and the god Osiris. The Nok culture existed during the late Pharonic period and intra-African trading could have spread Egyptian influences into many other parts of Africa.

According to this archived link, the Minneapolis Institute of Art deaccessioned this piece on 2014-12-09. In 2016, the [Daily Post](https://dailypost.ng/2016/05/18/france-returns-nok-terracotta-illegally-exported-from-nigeria/) and others reported that "France has formally presented to Nigeria an artifact, a Terracotta figurative sculpture that was repatriated after it was intercepted in France while in transit from Togo to the United States in 2008", which means it's unlikely to be this piece, however, those articles often used this image above.

While these are incredible pieces—see examples at [Wikipedia on Nok culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nok_culture)!—they are terribly trafficked, see
- ["Inside the illicit trade in West Africa’s oldest artworks"](https://mg.co.za/africa/2020-10-25-inside-the-illicit-trade-in-west-africas-oldest-artworks/) and
- ["Nok Terracottas" at Trafficking Culture](https://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/nok-terracottas/)

Information on where this piece is now would be greatly appreciated, as would a credit for the image above.

> The Lady of Elche (in Spanish, Dama de Elche; in Valencian, Dama d'Elx) is a limestone bust that was discovered in 1897, at La Alcudia, an archaeological site on a private estate two kilometers south of Elche, Spain. It is generally known as an Iberian artifact from the 4th century BC, although the artisanship suggests strong Hellenistic influences. According to The Encyclopedia of Religion, the Lady of Elche is believed to have a direct association with Tanit, the goddess of Carthage, who was worshiped by the Punic-Iberians.

See also [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mask-of-the-bat-god) entry: "This strange and sinister jade mask was discovered by archeologists excavating a tomb in the ruins of the ancient city of Monte Alban, once the heart of the powerful Zapotec civilization. Although some scholarly disagreement remains as to what purpose this mask served, it is overwhelmingly acknowledged that it portrays a bat… You can find the mask in the Oaxaca hall of the National Museum of Anthropology (Museo Nacional de Antropologia) in Chapultepec Park, along with many more batty artifacts."
