See also [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mask-of-the-bat-god) entry: "This strange and sinister jade mask was discovered by archeologists excavating a tomb in the ruins of the ancient city of Monte Alban, once the heart of the powerful Zapotec civilization. Although some scholarly disagreement remains as to what purpose this mask served, it is overwhelmingly acknowledged that it portrays a bat… You can find the mask in the Oaxaca hall of the National Museum of Anthropology (Museo Nacional de Antropologia) in Chapultepec Park, along with many more batty artifacts."
